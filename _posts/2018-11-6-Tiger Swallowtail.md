Papilio glaucus Linnaeus (Eastern Tiger Swallowtail)

The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail is beautiful yellow buttefly very commonly found in the Eatern parts of the United States, streatching all the way from the East Coast to Western Colorado. This species follows their host plants to lay their eggs. The caterpillars from this butterfly will spend it's life eating leaves from plants, such as wild cherry, sweetbay magnolia, basswood, tulip tree, birch, ash, cottonwood, mountain ash and willow. Tiger Swallowtails are generalists, meaning the caterpillars are able to feed from a wide variety of host plants.

As an adult, the Tiger Swallowtail will feed on nectar from  wild cherry tree flowers, Lilacs, Milkweed, and the Joe-Pye Weed.

These butterflies' wingspan reaches up to about 4 inches, so they're hard to miss. Males and females are very easy to distingush. Males are yellow with dark brown tiger stripes on both sides of its wings. Females, however, have two different forms. Some females look very similar to males, except with small blue and orange details on their lower wings. The other kind of female is very obvious to tell. This butterfly is dark brown, both front and back wings with even darker tiger stripes.

The butterfly in the image below is a female Eastern Tiger Swallowtail.
