The Karner Blue is an endangered species of butterfly, commonly found in the Northeastern parts of the United States. In May of 2000, the species was declared extinct in Canada, due to human activity and habitat loss. Today, is it now illegal to have this species in possesion, or to collect them. Luckily, the population has grown since they landed this list, thanks to wildlife conservation programs and environmental protaction efforts.
