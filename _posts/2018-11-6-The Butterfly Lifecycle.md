##The Egg

The butterfly will always lay its eggs on its host plant. Once the egg hatches, the caterpillar will only eat the leaves of the host plant, so it's important for the butterfly to choose a safe place on the right plant. The eggs are always hidden on the underside of the leaf, in order to avoid them getting hurt or eaten by another animal.

##The Caterpillar 

The caterpillar will spend its life eating, in order to prepare for the next stage of life. Once it hatches, it will eat what's left of its egg, the eat away at the leaves of its host plant. All of that protein needs to be stored away to be used when the caterpillar begins its transformation.

##The Chrysalis

After the caterpillar has eaten enough, it'll find a safe place to stay while it goes through the transportation. Once it has chosen its spot, the caterpillar will hand itself from the leaf or branch, from its butt. It's commonly believed that it will weave its pupa, but that's not true. It'll actually shed its outermost layer of skin, and that'll be the pupa. Once the caterpillar is comfy, it'll stay there until the future butterfly is fully developed.

##The Butterfly

Once the butterfly is ready to come out of the pupa, it'll break itself out carefully, trying not to fall. This next step is very important. Once it's our, the butterfly has to continue to hang on the branch, upside down and let gravity spread out its wings. That what all the food is for, from the caterpillar stage. After it used all of its energy to transform, it needs whatever is left over to get protein and blood to its wings. If this process is interrupted, then it could permanently damage its ability to fly. After the butterfly is successful, it'll fly off to find a mate and lay its eggs.
